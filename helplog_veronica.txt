Final Project Milestone 1 Help Log:

Wednesday:
Q: Getting FBM to have good peeks
A: Don’t need to alter the actual FBM function but try changing the height of the max peek and 

Q: How is chunking more efficient when I still have 4 for loops?
A: It’s not, it’s more efficient when rendering not when writing out the actual code

Q: Generating new terrain, need to match height? If so how?
Can I automatically have new terrain become a new biome?
A: FBM is a continuous function so adding new terrain should start at x and z values where the previous terrain left off


Thursday:
Q: Is it ok to have a setBlockAt function in both the chunk class and the terrain class?
A: Yes, just need to make sure they are "synced" i.e. chunk's function should call the terrain's function

Q: Ray march set up—using vec3’s and for loop to go through each direction, need to find smallest tnear out of closest blocks…but how am I getting the closest books to test against them? Is that where setting min & max comes in?
A: Code I had was not for ray-marching but for ray cube intersection. I was confused and thinking that they're the same thing. I re-implemented the function with ray-marching and got it to work.
