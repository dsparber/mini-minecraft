Final Project Milestone 1 Help Log:

Wednesday:
Q: Getting FBM to have good peeks
A: Don’t need to alter the actual FBM function but try changing the height of the max peek and 

Q: How is chunking more efficient when I still have 4 for loops?
A: It’s not, it’s more efficient when rendering not when writing out the actual code

Q: Generating new terrain, need to match height? If so how?
Can I automatically have new terrain become a new biome?
A: FBM is a continuous function so adding new terrain should start at x and z values where the previous terrain left off

Thursday:
Q: Is it ok to have a setBlockAt function in both the chunk class and the terrain class?
A: Yes, just need to make sure they are "synced" i.e. chunk's function should call the terrain's function

Q: Ray march set up—using vec3’s and for loop to go through each direction, need to find smallest tnear out of closest blocks…but how am I getting the closest books to test against them? Is that where setting min & max comes in?
A: Code I had was not for ray-marching but for ray cube intersection. I was confused and thinking that they're the same thing. I re-implemented the function with ray-marching and got it to work.

Saturday:
Q: Getting ray marching to work — delete block. How to set max length and how to get rid of crashing
A: Needed to multiple my step by look vector and set my origin position to be the camera’s eye

Final Project Milestone 2 Help Log:

Friday:
Q: Rounding bottom of river
A: Use radius to loop through every direction of cube. If the given block is within the radius then set it to water

Saturday:
Q: How to get drawRules map to compile?
A: Needed to put River:: in front of rule definition and when calling functions

Q: Getting stack to work—>Turtle construction error
A: Need copy constructor in Turtle class

Q: What does the look vector in Turtle do? Do I need both that and an angle? How do I set look initially? 
A: Don’t necessarily need both. Look vector gives x and z orientation at the current position. Multiply look by position to get current vector. I can initially set them to whatever I want.

Q: How to test what I have so far? Do I need to merge first? Or do rasterizer thing, if rasterizer pls help me set up rasterizer?
A: Either one will work, may be easier to merge since rasterizer only tests drawing functions, not carving.

Sunday:
Q: Carving out terrain, how to get perpendicular vector etc?
A: A simpler way to get perpendicular is to just rotate by 90 degrees

Q: Getting river to draw — how to call my draw functions, check expand string
A: Need to have an instance of river (this->*r)();

Tuesday:
Q: Getting carveTerrain function to work/do anything
A: Didn’t really get an answer
